# 🦠 COVID-19 Country-Wise Analysis (EDA)
## 📄 Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the country_wise_latest.csv dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The dataset provides country-level summaries of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and other related statistics.
The aim of this analysis is to understand the global impact of COVID-19, identify trends, and visualize country-wise patterns.

# 📊 Objectives

- To explore and clean the dataset.

- To analyze confirmed, recovered, and death cases across countries.

- To visualize top affected countries.

- To identify correlations between variables.

- To generate insights that summarize the spread and impact of COVID-19.
